## Project 6:
### Whale Talk

This project is practice the use of loops in javascript, its come codeacademy course introduction to javascript.Take a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’.

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.
Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.

## Project 7:
### Mini  linting

Linting, a process by which text is evaluated and improved by an application.This small appliaction use arrays and iteration methods, like 
This methods dont change the original value of the array iterate.
map() : this method will loop over all the elements excuting the callback function and returning a array.
forEach() :it will excute  the callback function over all element, but if the this function doest fill the condition it will return indefine.
reduce(): it may have to parameters ,accumulator, currentValue, it will return one value, example the sum of all the element of the array.
filter():Iterate over all the element of the array and generate a new array. For those element who has evaluated true, are return.
